This is my 75% keyboard featuring 3 slider potentiometers and a large OLED screen. The case is made from aluminum and 
includes a brass weight. Based on the CAD design, the estimated weight is around 5 pounds. 

This is my first keyboard project, and so far, I've completed the CAD design for the case. I'm currently learning 
KiCad to design my own PCB, with the goal of assembling this keyboard in real life.
